                <h2>How I began music?</h2>
                
                <p>I only started creating music a few months ago. 
                    Before that, I'd already learned to play the piano, but all I did was read sheet music. 
                    Music creation is first and foremost a passion, but I'd love to integrate it into a computer project, such as creating a video game. 
                    Below you'll find 4 pieces of music I've created.
