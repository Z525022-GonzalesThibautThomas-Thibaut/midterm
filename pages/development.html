                <h2>How I learned Computer Science</h2>
                
                <p>I started learning coding on my own during my high school years. 
                I started by developing video games in C using the SDL2 library.
                After that, I quickly got interested in website development, starting by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, then moving on to web frameworks like Symfony. 
                I then began my higher education with a bachelor's degree at the University of Clermont Auvergne, before joining an engineering school, ISIMA, which is part of the large INP school group. 
                During these years of study, I had the opportunity to work again on video game development, in SDL2 and with Unity. 
                I also had the opportunity to learn the basics of data analysis.

                <h2>My web projects</h2>
                
                <p>I started learning coding on my own during my high school years. 
                    I've had the opportunity to do a number of personal web projects in my spare time. However, since I did these projects for fun and training, I never bought an online server to host my projects, so you won't be able to find my projects online.
                    The first project I did was a social drawing network, using the Symfony framework. There was a system for creating accounts and publishing images.
                    The second project is one I did with my brother, who is a full stack web developer. It's a site that lets you capture a random pokemon every day, the aim being to complete your collection as quickly as possible. This project was coded in React.
                    Finally, the last project I worked on was a project management website. It allowed you to manage the organization of a project by adding tasks to be done with a deadline, organizing the different tasks according to their importance and their deadline. This project was also coded in React.

                <p>
                    I developed my first game shortly after learning to code. 
                    It was my first real computer project, and I chose to make a point-and-click game where you had to click on crystals before they disappeared (if a crystal has time to disappear, the game is lost). 
                    I coded the game in C using the SDL library. 
                    Several years had passed before I coded my second game, as part of a project for my school. 
                    This time me and my team recoded the Chinese checkers game, using the Unity engine. 
                    Then I coded my third game a year later, again for a school project. 
                    For this project I had to go back to C and SDL2, and my team and I decided to code the game Sushi Go.

                <p>
                    Over the past year, I've had the opportunity to acquire skills in a new area: data analysis. 
                    In particular, I studied data preparation and numerous analysis methods such as SVM, Random Forest and neural networks. 
                    As a project, I had to work on a patient database in order to set up a system capable of predicting strokes in patients. 
                    I managed to get a prediction rate of 26%, which is pretty encouraging for something as hard to predict as stroke!
