                <h2>How I learned Computer Science</h2>
                
                <p>I started learning coding on my own during my high school years. 
                I started by developing video games in C using the SDL2 library.
                After that, I quickly got interested in website development, starting by learning the basics of HTML and CSS, then moving on to web frameworks like Symfony. 
                I then began my higher education with a bachelor's degree at the University of Clermont Auvergne, before joining an engineering school, ISIMA, which is part of the large INP school group. 
                During these years of study, I had the opportunity to work again on video game development, in SDL2 and with Unity. 
                I also had the opportunity to learn the basics of data analysis.

                <p>I started learning coding on my own during my high school years. 
                    I've had the opportunity to do a number of personal web projects in my spare time. However, since I did these projects for fun and training, I never bought an online server to host my projects, so you won't be able to find my projects online.
                    The first project I did was a social drawing network, using the Symfony framework. There was a system for creating accounts and publishing images.
                    The second project is one I did with my brother, who is a full stack web developer. It's a site that lets you capture a random pokemon every day, the aim being to complete your collection as quickly as possible. This project was coded in React.
                    Finally, the last project I worked on was a project management website. It allowed you to manage the organization of a project by adding tasks to be done with a deadline, organizing the different tasks according to their importance and their deadline. This project was also coded in React.
